NAME
    password-locker - create and manage passwords in an encrypted file

SYNOPSIS
    password-locker command [options]

DESCRIPTION
    The password-locker program is a utility that manages a list of passwords in an encrypted file

OPTIONS
    Command line option specifications are processed from left to right.
    Options can not be specified more than once. If conflicting options
    are specified, earlier specifications override later ones.

    All commands require the following options:

    <required>
    -f         The path to the password archive

    <optional>
    -a         An mcrypt algorithm (list available algorithms with list-alogs)
               defaults to MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256

    -m         An mcrypt mode (list available modes with list-modes)
               defaults to MCRYPT_MODE_CBC

    -h         A hashing algorithm (list available algorithms with list-hash-algos)
               defaults to sha256

    -p         The password protecting the archive.
               This will be prompted for if not set


    <commands>
    create     Creates a new password entry. If the key already exists the user
               will be prompted to confirm overwrite.

        --id   <String>            An id to use as reference for this password
        --raw  [optional] <String> The raw password string. If a value is not
                                   defined then a random password is generated


    update     Alias of create


    read       Reads a single password out of the encrypted file

        --id   <String> The id of the password to read


    read-all   Reads the entire archive and prints each id:pass to screen

        --b64d [optional] <Void> When provided the id and pass are base64 decoded
                                 before being printed (this is defaulted to false)

    list-keys  Same as read-all but only prints recorded ids


    delete     Deletes a id:pass pair from the archive after asking for confirmation

        --id   <String> The id of the password to delete


UTILITY COMMANDS
